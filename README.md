My name is **Subham Bhattacharjee ðŸš€**. I'm a 24 year old, full-stack software engineer.
Passionate about helping organisations solve their large scale, distributed technical problems.

I prefer to write **back-end** code, but i can do front-end if needed.  
**Python, Golang, JavaScript** is my programming language of choice.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a part of a team, developing some of the most cutting-edge software experiences on the market
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to talk to different microservices efficiently, Distributed System, and Chaos Engineering
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, Golang, JavaScript
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **subhaminion** is my default username for all social media
- âš¡ Fun fact: When not firefighting at work, I love a cup of Ginger Tea on a rainy evening, and anything that involves jumping off from ridiculous heights (think airplanes and cliffs).
