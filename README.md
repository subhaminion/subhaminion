### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### My name is **Subham Bhattacharjee ðŸš€**. I'm a 24 year old, full-stack software engineer. Passionate about helping organisations solve their large scale, distributed technical problems.

I prefer to write **back-end** code, but I can do front-end if needed.  
**Python, Golang, JavaScript** is my programming language of choice.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: **subhaminion** is my default username for all social media
- âš¡ Fun fact: When not firefighting at work, I love a cup of Ginger Tea on a rainy evening, and anything that involves jumping off from ridiculous heights (think airplanes and cliffs).
